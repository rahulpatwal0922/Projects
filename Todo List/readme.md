# TODO LIST 

Todo list is a web app used to maintain our day to day tasks and list everything that we have to do with the most important task at the top of the list and least
least important task at the bottom of the list. 
It is helpful for daily planning. We can add more tasks at any time and delete a task that is completed.

This app is created using <b>html</b>, <b>CSS</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>, <b>Bootstrap</b> and <b>jQuery</b>.
Html is used to give a structure to todo list web app and a little bit of Css for styling the app.
In bootstrap I use containers, buttons, list-group, icons, buttons etc to make it look good and resopinsive.
Javascript is used to give functionality and dynamic behaviour to the buttons.

The todo list app contains four buttons to add, clear, delete and sort the tasks.
Add button - is used to add the task in the list. The add button is disabled until there is not task to add.
Clear button - is used to clear the task on the input.
Sort button - is used to sort the tasks. All the completed tasks move to the end of the list.
Delete button - is used to delete all the tasks form the list.
